# SecureFL

SecureFL is a privacy-first Federated Learning system built for security, efficiency, and real-world resilience.

### It integrates:

* âœ… Differential Privacy for noise-based anonymization
* âœ… Homomorphic Encryption for encrypted computations
* âœ… Autoencoders for encoded gradient transmission
* âœ… Defenses against noising & gradient leakage attacks

This project aims to redefine secure collaboration in FL by combining advanced cryptography, deep learning, and robust attack mitigation.

> ğŸ”§ Currently under development â€” architecture design & core modules in progress.

### ğŸ§  Vision

**Train together, stay private.**

SecureFL ensures zero raw data exposure, even under adversarial conditions.

### Tech Stack

`Python 3.10.17`
