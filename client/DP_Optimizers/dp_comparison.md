## Key Differences and Performance*
1. Dimensionality (DL models): In high-dimensional settings, the Gaussian mechanism generally outperforms Laplace due to less added noise. Conversely, Laplace can outperform Gaussian in very low dimensions. 
2. Privacy vs. Utility Trade-off: Laplace offers a stronger privacy guarantee but typically adds more noise, leading to greater utility loss, especially in higher dimensions. 
3. Practical Considerations: The choice between the two depends on the specific application, including the dimensionality of the data, the nature of the queries, and the desired balance between privacy and data accuracy. 

**In Summary**
1. For high privacy and low-dimensional data, or when exploiting irregular sensitivities, consider Laplace. 
2. For high-dimensional data where a balance is needed or a weaker privacy guarantee is acceptable, consider Gaussian. 

The Core Issue: Same Epsilon ≠ Same Noise Level ≠ Same Accuracy
Let me explain why Configuration 2 seems contradictory in simple terms:

**Why Same Epsilon but Different Accuracy?**
The epsilon value (ε=1.8) represents "privacy loss" - but the two mechanisms achieve this privacy loss in fundamentally different ways:

## The Real Comparison
Epsilon alone is not a fair comparison metric when mechanisms use different accounting methods!

For truly fair comparisons:

**Option A - Same Noise Level (Configuration 1):**
Gaussian: noise_multiplier=1.0 → ε≈1.8
Laplace: epsilon_total=400.0 → noise_scale≈1.0
Result: Similar accuracy, very different epsilon values

**Option B - Same Privacy Method:**
Use both with simple composition, or both with RDP accounting
Result: More meaningful epsilon comparison

The key insight is that Gaussian mechanism is actually more efficient - it achieves the same privacy guarantee with less noise due to superior accounting methods, contrary to what might seem intuitive. This is why Gaussian DP-SGD is preferred in practice for machine learning applications.

**"Count on Your Elders: Laplace vs Gaussian"**
* `"Gaussian noise is the standard approach to approximate differential privacy in ML... Laplace may be preferable for simple statistics but Gaussian dominates for deep learning applications"` 
* `"Gaussian noise has become popular in ML, often replacing Laplace noise... Gaussian noise is the standard approach to approximate differential privacy, often resulting in much higher utility than traditional mechanisms"`
* The paper gives an advanced method for Laplace Noise. It is the key finding of the paper.
  * Theorem 3 in the paper...
* The paper demonstrates that:
  * Traditional Laplace: Uses L1 sensitivity (Δ₁) for pure ε-DP
  * Advanced Laplace: Uses L2 sensitivity (Δ₂) for (ε,δ)-DP
  * Gaussian: Uses L2 sensitivity (Δ₂) for (ε,δ)-DP

### Why Very Large ε is Expected in Traditional Laplace:
* Laplace mechanism designed for simple queries (count, sum)
* NOT optimized for deep learning gradient updates
* High ε value indicates poor privacy-utility trade-off for ML
